# Modular "Tic Tac Toe" made in Java using JavaFX

## How to run it
* Download/Clone the repo and import the project into your IDE (InteliJ IDEA was used in this case).
* Download and add the [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) libray to the project.
* Build and run.
* OOOOOR just download the EXE: **(soon)**

## Ok,what's so "modular" ?
By using the settings dialog at the start of the program you can change:
    * Window's size
    * Play area size (grid's size)
    * How many sprites of the same type are necessary in order to win
    * Who starts first
