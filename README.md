## How to run it

* Download/Clone the repo and import the project into your IDE (InteliJ IDEA was used in this case).
* Download and add the [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) library to the project.
* Build and run.
* OOOOOR just download the **TicTacToe Build** containing the **.exe** file (in the bin folder) 

## Ok, what's so "modular"?

By using the settings dialog at the start of the program you can change:

* Window's size
* Play area size (grid's size)
* How many sprites of the same type are necessary in order to win
* Who starts first
